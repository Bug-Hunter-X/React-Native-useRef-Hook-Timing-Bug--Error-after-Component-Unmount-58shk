This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the ref's callback is executed.  This often happens when navigating away from a screen quickly, or when a component's lifecycle is interrupted unexpectedly.  The callback attempts to access a component that no longer exists, resulting in the error. This is a subtle bug because it might not manifest immediately and only appear under specific timing conditions.

```javascript
// Example of problematic code
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Perform actions with myRef.current here.  This is problematic if component unmounts
      // before this is executed.
      myRef.current.focus(); 
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput ref={myRef} />
    </View>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```
